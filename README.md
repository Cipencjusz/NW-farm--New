# NW-farm--New
Read first before use 

!!!!!!   PLEASE MAKE A SAFE COPY OF YOUR fallout76prefs.ini and fallout76.ini BEFORE USE !!!!!!

Works only with english language client with 800 x 600 resolution !!!

Instalation guide:

1) You need to download AutoHotkey for make it work.
2) You can download SciTE4AutoHotkey editor for better code review and easy edit file.
3) Download both files and put them in the same folder.
4) Name of F76PrefsReplacmentNW.ahk CAN'T be changed.
5) Name of NW lvling.ahk - CAN be changed and reccomend to do it - name it with some random name like qwerty ect.
6) Setup correct paths for fallout76prefs.ini and fallout76.ini in F76PrefsReplacmentNW.ahk . 
I reccomend You to make second script with Your current prefs setup and use it when You wanna play normally with better resolution.
7) Setup correct path for game folder in NW lvling.ahk
8) If You want the sript to auto restart game and login - setup options in NW lvling.ahk
9) If You don't wanna use autologin - Run F76PrefsReplacmentNW.ahk, open game, login, close news tab and leave it in main menu
10) Run NW lvling.ahk 

; LEFT ALT + P - START SCRIPT  - Start corretly only when You are loged in and in main menu, if You have AutoLogin setuped it will also start without F76 opened.

; LEFT ALT + Z - EXIT SCRIPT

11) Go do Your stuff.
